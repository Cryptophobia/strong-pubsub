/**
 * The Client class provides a unified pubsub client in node.js and browsers. It
 * supports subscribing to topics or topic patterns (topics + wildcards). Clients
 * can connect to brokers or proxies that support the client.adapterâ€™s protocol.
 *
 * ```js
 * var Client = require('strong-pubsub-client');
 * var Adapter = require('strong-pubsub-mqtt');
 * var client = new Client({
 *   host: 'my.mqtt-broker.com',
 *   port: 6543
 * }, Adapter);
 * ```
 *
 * #### Events
 *
 * **Event: `connect`**
 *
 * Emitted on successful connection (or reconnection).
 *
 * **Event: `error`**
 *
 * Emitted when a connection could not be established.
 *
 * @param {Object} options See `client.options` below.
 * @param {Function} Adapter The adapter constructor.
 * @param {Object} [transport] The optional transport module implementing `require('net').createConnection()`.
 * @property {string} settings.http.path Base URL of the model HTTP route.
 * @class

 * Publish a `message` to the specified `topic`.

 * @param {Queue} [options.queue] A `Queue` object to bind the topic to. Only supported using the **STOMP** adapter.

 *
 * **Supported Values**
 *
 *   - `0` - Just as reliable as TCP. Client will not get any missed messages (while it was disconnected).
 *   - `1` - Client receives missed messages at least once and sometimes more than once.
 *   - `2` - Client receives missed messages only once.
 *
 * **Note: this setting is not supported by non mqtt brokers!**
 *
